/*
 * A NOTE ABOUT UPDATEING OUR WERD *SS FONTS
 * 
 * Even though we use webfonts for our headings and icons, we must serve 
 * those fonts from our own sites to get around "the great firewall of china"
 * 
 * All the fonts should live in ig_neato/fonts, and the css/scss in those fonts
 * should be pulled in through the variables section below. We do it this way
 * instead of through the .info file so that we can use auto-prefixing, linting,
 * and minification.
 *
 * For Roboto Slab Updates:
 * I used https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts to pull google fonts local
 * We chose Roboto slab specifically because it supports many non-latin languages.
 * I don't forsee needing to update this font unless a new file type comes into 
 * fashion. Last updated from the cloud on 1-7-2018 -RRN 
 *
 * Icomoon fonts are designed to be cloud hosted - so it's a pain in the dick to 
 * update these locally. You'll have to go to the icomoon browser app, update
 * the font, go to the far right tab, and click "download". Then you can paste 
 * the whole folder in ig_neato/fonts. (You should delete the demo content that
 * comes with it by default.)  The default download will have a css
 * file already compiled. We use that. If you don't use a file suffix (ex: .css) in the 
 * @import, sass will include the css content in the css output.  If you do use 
 * a suffix in the @import, that .css file won't be aggregated, instead it will
 * be linked to, and you get an additional file call.
 * You'll need to go into the style.css files and replace:
 * url('fonts/ with url('../fonts/<font folder name>/fonts/)
 *
 * Icomoon does offer the option to generate .scss files,
 * but we do not use them because they have problems with name space 
 * collisions.  (We use two different icomoon font sets and the default variable
 * names are the same.)  As of 1-8-18 Danny Pouley and Ryan Ray Neff have access
 * to the icomoon account credentials. Icomoon also has the option to encode the
 * font as utf-8 and embed in your css. Don't do this, it slows down your main 
 * css load, and not every font is used on every page.
