/* Icomoon fonts are designed to be cloud hosted - so it's a pain in the dick to 
 * update these locally. You'll have to go to the icomoon browser app, update
 * the font, go to the AWS link, paste the css here, update the url to point
 * to the correct fonts path, and then download any external fonts from aws and 
 * paste them into the folder in this theme.
 *
 * In 2017 there was an intermittent issue where icomoon icons were'nt displaying 
 * properly. I suspect this was caused by setting the setting:
 * Font->Preferences->Encode & embedd fonts in CSS
 * option in the icomoon app. Toggling that setting switches
 * the font between utf-8 encoding embedded in css, and alternately, breaking
 * the font into 6 seperate font files. (woff, woff2, svg ect...)  
 * If the problem persists, you may have to toggle that setting and add the other 
 * 5 fonts to the fonts/icomoon folder.
