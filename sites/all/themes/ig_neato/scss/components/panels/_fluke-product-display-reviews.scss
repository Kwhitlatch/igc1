// Styling for Bazaar Voice reviews. 
// The bv section was formerly styled by overrwriting styles added dynamically
// by the bvapi.js script in clickability. 
// We now do the bulk of the theming through the bv
// console at https://config.portal.bazaarvoice.com/siteManager

#fluke-product-display-reviews {
  ol.bv-content-list-Comments > .bv-secondary-content-comment {
    padding-left: 15px !important;
  }
  // The lazyloader module interferes with images found in reviews, because it
  // hides all images by default, and the bv.js script adds the images back in 
  // at an odd time. to circumvent this, we need to inherit display with !important 
  // Example product: /en-us/product/accessories/test-leads/fluke-tl175
  img[data-src] { 
    display: inherit !important;
  }
