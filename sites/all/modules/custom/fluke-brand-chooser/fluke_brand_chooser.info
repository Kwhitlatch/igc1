name = Fluke Brand Chooser
description = Super fast loading brand chooser for fluke.com.  This page is built using npm, and optimized for speed. To support this, it completely bypasses the theme layer, and most
of the images are inline svgs, with .gif fallbacks that live in the dam.  To update the page, you'll need to use node.js and recompile.  Check the readme.md in brand-chooser folder for more info.
